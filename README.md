# Spyfall 2.0

## What is Spyfall? Why 2.0?

It's a web game based on the classic card game *Spyfall*, and based on every other Spyfall web game ever made, but better. We made this during our internship at CodeLabs 2020!

## Who made it?

Cirill Dalangin, Shreya Kalyan, and Lavanya Sharma made this with love. Our group is called the CyberSpies cuz we love to code and our project is all about spies. We were also mentored by Alex Parra, the smartest and chillest dude ever!

## How we built it?
